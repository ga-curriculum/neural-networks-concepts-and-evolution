## 1. Introduction to Python for AI (15 min)

Python is the **lingua franca of artificial intelligence and deep learning** due to its simplicity, readability, and powerful ecosystem of libraries.

| Concept | Description | Example |
|----------|--------------|----------|
| High-level language | Easy-to-read syntax, close to English | `print("Hello AI!")` |
| Interpreted | No compilation needed | Run directly in terminal or Jupyter |
| Versatile | Used in AI, web dev, automation | TensorFlow, Flask, Pandas |

**Example: Basic Python Syntax**

```python
# Variables and types
name = "AI Learner"
hours = 32
print(f"Welcome {name}, to {hours} hours of AI training!")
```
---

## 3. Setting Up the Development Environment (15 min)

Ensure all required tools are installed and verified.

✅ Required Tools

✅Python 3.9+

✅Jupyter Notebooks or VS Code

✅Git and GitHub account

✅Key Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, PyTorch

✅Zoom, Slack, and Chrome (for course delivery)

 **Sanity Check**

Run these commands to confirm setup:
```python --version
jupyter --version
git --version
pip list
```
Activity:
Learners open Jupyter, create a new notebook titled "Module1_Setup.ipynb", and run:
```
import numpy, pandas, sklearn
print("✅ Environment setup complete!")
```
---

## 4. Python Essentials for Machine Learning (20 min)
**Key Topics**
1. Variables, data types, lists, dictionaries, and loops
2. Writing and calling functions
3. Handling exceptions and debugging

**Example:**
```
def normalize(data):
    """Return normalized values between 0 and 1."""
    return (data - data.min()) / (data.max() - data.min())

import pandas as pd
scores = pd.Series([10, 15, 20, 25])
print(normalize(scores))
```

**Mini Exercise:**
Write a function that squares each number in a list and returns the new list.
```
numbers = [2, 4, 6]
# Output: [4, 16, 36]
```
---
## 5. Data Handling and Libraries (20 min)

**Focus:** Core libraries for AI and ML workflows.

| Library | Purpose | Example |
|----------|----------|----------|
| **NumPy** | Numerical computation | `np.mean(arr)` |
| **Pandas** | Data manipulation | `df.describe()` |
| **Matplotlib** | Visualization | `plt.plot()` |

**Follow-Along Code:**
```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

data = np.random.randn(100)
df = pd.DataFrame({'values': data})
plt.hist(df['values'], bins=20)
plt.title("Random Data Distribution")
plt.show()
Copy code
```
---
## 6. Introduction to Git and Version Control (15 min)

Version control helps track changes, collaborate, and revert errors efficiently.

**Key Commands**
```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```
**Concepts:**

1.Repository: Project folder with version history

2.Commit: Snapshot of code changes

3.Branch: Separate workspace for experiments

---
## 7. Working with GitHub (10 min)

**Connecting to GitHub**
```git remote add origin https://github.com/username/repo.git
git push -u origin main
```

**Branching Workflow Example**
```git checkout -b feature-branch
# Work on code
git commit -am "Added data visualization section"
git checkout main
git merge feature-branch
```

**In-Class Collaboration Activity:**

Students pair up and fork a practice repository to make and merge changes.

---

## 8. Lab: Baseline Builder – Logistic Regression (Setup) (10 min)

**Objective:** Implement your first ML model using Scikit-learn.

```from sklearn.datasets import load_digits
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score


X, y = load_digits(return_X_y=True)
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)
model = LogisticRegression(max_iter=1000)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

pred = model.predict(X_test)
print("Baseline Accuracy:", accuracy_score(y_test, pred))
```


**Discussion:**

1. What does the model learn?
2. How can we improve this baseline in later modules (hint: neural networks)?

---
   
## 9. Wrap-Up and Reflection (5 min)

**Group Discussion:**
1. What challenges did you face while setting up your environment?
2. Which Python concept felt most familiar or new to you?
3. How does Git enhance collaboration in AI projects?

**Instructor Notes:**
1. Reiterate learning outcomes achieved.
2. Preview next module: Deep Learning with PyTorch.
